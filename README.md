# Buttercup Bakery - Flexbox project

A Codecademy project to design and build a homepage for a business of my choice using the CSS flexbox property.

I invented a bakery to make the homepage for and created a simple home page listing some products and staff members as well as how to contact them. The project was written using HTML 5 and CSS3 and makes use of the CSS flexbox property to make it responsive.
